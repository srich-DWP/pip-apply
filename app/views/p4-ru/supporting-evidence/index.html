      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Upload supporting evidence for your PIP application</h1>
      <p class="govuk-body-l">It is important that you help us to understand your needs by uploading any documentary evidence or information. This should explain how your health condition or disability affects your daily life.</p>

      <p>Examples of documents you could upload include:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>reports about you from health professionals</li>
          <li>care or treatment plans</li>
          <li>test results</li>
          <li>repeat prescription lists</li>
        </ul>

      <p><a href="/public/pdfs/pip2-supporting-evidence-help-v1.pdf" download>Help with the types of supporting evidence you should upload and send&nbsp;(PDF)</a></p>

      <p>If you have any paper documents to upload, take photos or scans of them and save these to the device you are using.</p>

      <p>Only upload copies of evidence or information you already have. If we need more, we will ask your health professional for it.</p>

      <p>Any delay in sending evidence you have might mean:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your claim to PIP will take longer to assess</li>
        <li>you might need an assessment with a health professional which might not have been necessary</li>
        <li>we might not be able to get all the information we need to make a decision on your claim which accurately reflects your daily living or mobility needs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Try to avoid:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>send general information about your condition like fact sheets or information from the internet</li>
        <li>contact your GP or health professional to ask for new or additional information as they may charge you for this</li>
      </ul>
