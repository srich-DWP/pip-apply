      <p>Dear [Full name],</p>

      <p>Thank you for starting your Personal Independence Payment (PIP) claim.</p>

      <p>We need to find out more information about your daily living and mobility needs to help us make our decision.</p>
 
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do</h2>
 
      <p>Tell DWP how your disability affects you and upload any supporting evidence using our online service.</p>

      <p>You do not need to answer all the questions in one go. Save the web address below in your internet browser or keep this email safe. This will let you easily return the service more than once if you need to.</p>

      <p>Before you start you’ll need:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your email address we sent this email to and access to your emails</li>
        <li>your National Insurance number</li>
        <li>your mobile phone</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Go to <a href="/test/sign-in/intro-question">[URL of service/HTML service identifier]</a></p>
       
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you need to do it by</h2>
       
      <p>Answer all the questions, upload any supporting evidence and submit them to DWP using the online service by xx Month 2020.</p>
       
      <p>If you do not do it by this date we may end your PIP claim. If you currently get Disability Living Allowance this will stop.</p>
       
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Get help</h2>
       
      <p>You can ask a friend, relative, carer, representative, or local support organisation to help you.</p>
       
      <p>There is information in each step of the online service to help you. You can also download PDF guides and a video from the ‘Help and contacts’ section.</p>
       
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Other ways to send your information</h2>
       
      <p>If you decide you would prefer to fill in and send a paper form and any supporting evidence in the post instead contact:</p>
       
      <p>Phone: 0800 121 4433<br>
      Textphone: 0800 121 4493 if you have speech or hearing difficulties</p>
       
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
       
      <p>Office Manager</p>
