        <li>washing your body, limbs, face, underarms and hair, and</li>
        <li>using a standard bath or shower</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This doesnâ€™t include any difficulties you have getting to the bathroom.</p>

      <p>We understand talking about your personal care needs can be difficult, but we need you to tell us as much as you can.</p>
