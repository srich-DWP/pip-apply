      <p class="govuk-body-l">It is important that you help us to understand your needs by uploading any documentary evidence or information you have. This should explain how your health condition or disability affects your daily life. </p>

      <p>If you have any paper documents to upload, take photos or scans of them and save these to the device you are using.</p>

      <p>Only upload copies of evidence or information you already have. If we need more, we will ask your health professional for it.</p>

      <p>Any delay in sending evidence you have might mean:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your claim to PIP will take longer to assess</li>
        <li>you might need an assessment with a health professional which might not have been necessary</li>
        <li>we might not be able to get all the information we need to make a decision on your claim which accurately reflects your daily living or mobility needs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Try to avoid:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>uploading general information about your condition like fact sheets or information from the internet</li>
        <li>contacting your GP or health professional to ask for new or additional information as they may charge you for this</li>
        <li>leaving your home to collect supporting information or contact your doctor or hospital during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak </li>
