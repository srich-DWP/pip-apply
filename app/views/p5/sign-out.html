      <p>You can <a href="/p5/sign-in/sign-in">sign in</a> again to finish your application. You might find it useful to bookmark the sign in page in your internet browser or use the link in the email we sent you.</p>
      <!-- <p>We will save this application until {% include 'includes/_date.html' %}. If you do not finish and send your application by this date but still want to claim, you will need to start your application again.</p> -->
      <!-- Note: deadline date removed for MVP as it varies by claimant -->

      <p>You will need your email address, mobile phone and password when you next sign in.</p>

      <p>It is now safe to close this window.</p>
