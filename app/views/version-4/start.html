          Apply for UK Shared Prosperity funding
        </h1>
        <p>The UK Shared Prosperity Fund is a fund that aims to improve employment prospects for people who are furthest from the labour market.</p>
        <p>It will do so by empowering organisations, those who know their areas and communities best, to shape decisions and reduce geographic inequalities.</p>
        <p>Funded projects will deliver new and specialised support to people between the ages of 18 and 65, who are unable to access mainstream employment programmes, or for whom mainstream employment programmes are unsuitable.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Any organisation with a UK business bank account that can prove they are capable of delivering a project that meets all of the needs listed in a competition.</p>
        <p>If an organisation cannot meet all of the needs listed in a competition, but is still eligible to be a lead applicant, they can invite partner organisations into a consortium effort that does  meet all of the needs listed.</p>
